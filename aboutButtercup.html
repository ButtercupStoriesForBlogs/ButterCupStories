      <h3>About Buttercup</h3>
      <br>
      <p> I am 27-year old young professional who shares birthday with Adolf Hitler. Almost a perfect Ambivert, because whenever I take any quizes it come out to be 51%-55% Extroversion. <br><br>
About family, only child of my parents, not a brat but a bit spoilt and pampered. Loves family dearly. Though only child but donâ€™t feel lack of siblings as I am quite close to many of my cousins.<br><br>
About love life, dates her best friend from last 3 years who has been friend since last 12 years. Most people know about my relationship except my parents who also kind of know it but refrain from acknowledging. <br><br>
By profession a coder who works in one of the top fintech company in the world. Lives and works in USA. <br><br>
Constant love in life apart from family and friends: Dance and humans.
Basic driving force in life is a constant urge to improve something everyday and to give to feel happy. Tries to live and conduct life in a way that once it ends, she is proud of it.<br><br>
The newest ritual added to life is daily workout in the mornings. Newest hobby is decluttering and cleaning, strange but true. <br><br>
Fighter at heart, never gives up, believes in goodness of people and has faith in life. Marginally intelligent and simple. <br><br>
